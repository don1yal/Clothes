# Clothes

Clothes is my first Spring Boot monolithic project. It is an e-commerce platform for clothing that includes features such as user management, shopping cart, order processing, payment integration, and product catalog.

## ðŸ“Œ About the Project
This project follows a monolithic architecture and demonstrates fundamental backend development principles, including:
- RESTful API design
- Spring Boot framework
- Database interactions using JPA and Hibernate
- User authentication and authorization
- Exception handling and logging

## ðŸš€ Technologies
- **Java 17** - Backend development
- **Spring Boot** - Framework for backend services
- **Spring Data JPA** - ORM for database interactions
- **Spring Security** - User authentication and authorization
- **MySQL** - Database
- **Lombok** - Reducing boilerplate code
- **MapStruct** - Object mapping
